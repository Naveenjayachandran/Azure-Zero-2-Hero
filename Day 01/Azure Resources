# Azure Resources

Azure resources are the core components of your cloud infrastructure in Microsoft Azure. These include virtual machines, databases, storage accounts, and other Azure services. Each resource is an individual, manageable entity that you can provision, configure, and maintain independently.

## Resource Groups in Azure

A Resource Group is a logical container that holds related Azure resources sharing the same lifecycle, permissions, and policies. It helps you organize and manage resources efficiently by grouping them together based on projects, environments, or applications.

### Key Points about Resource Groups:

- **Lifecycle Management:**  
  Resources inside a group can be deployed, updated, or deleted together as a single unit, simplifying management tasks.

- **Resource Organization:**  
  Grouping resources logically keeps your Azure environment structured and easier to maintain.

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  
  Permissions and access can be assigned at the resource group level, allowing control over who can access or modify the resources within the group.

## Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Overview

Azure Resource Manager (ARM) is the deployment and management service for Azure resources. It provides a consistent and unified management layer that enables you to deploy, update, and manage resources using declarative templates.

### Key Features of Azure Resource Manager:

- **Template-Based Deployment:**  
  ARM uses JSON templates (ARM templates) to define the infrastructure and configuration of your resources. This allows for repeatable, automated, and consistent deployments.

- **Dependency Management:**  
  ARM automatically resolves dependencies between resources, ensuring they are created in the correct order.

- **Rollback and Roll-forward:**  
  In case of deployment failures, ARM can roll back changes to maintain a stable environment or roll forward to the last known good state.

- **Tagging and Categorization:**  
  Tags (key-value pairs) can be applied to resources to organize, filter, and manage them more effectively.
