# Basics of Cloud Computing

## What is the Cloud?
Think of the cloud like a powerful computer you can use over the internet.  
It’s a place where you can store files, run apps, and use services—without needing to own or manage the actual hardware.

## What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing means using the internet to get access to computing services like storage, software, and servers.  
Instead of buying and managing your own computers, you use resources provided by others (like Google, Amazon, or your own company).  

These services are run from data centers all over the world, and you can access them from anywhere with an internet connection.

### Hybrid Cloud
**Who Uses It**: Businesses that need both private and public options.  
**What It's Like**: A mix – you use your private space for sensitive stuff, and the public cloud when you need more space or power.  
**Example**: Storing important data in a private cloud but using public cloud services for emails or backups.
