# Azure Blob Storage ‚Äì Complete Overview

## ‚úÖ What is Azure Blob Storage?

Azure Blob Storage is Microsoft Azure‚Äôs object storage solution for the cloud. It is designed to store massive volumes of unstructured data‚Äîdata that doesn‚Äôt adhere to a particular data model or definition (such as text or binary data).

> **Blob = Binary Large Object**

Data is stored in a storage account ‚Üí containers ‚Üí blobs.

Each blob is addressable via a unique URL (REST-based access).

## ‚úÖ Blob Types

Azure Blob Storage supports three types of blobs:

- **Block blobs** ‚Äì For storing text and binary data, ideal for documents, media files, etc.
- **Append blobs** ‚Äì Optimized for append operations; useful for logging.
- **Page blobs** ‚Äì For random read/write operations; mainly used for Azure VM disks (VHDs).

## ‚úÖ When to Use Azure Blob Storage?

Use it when you need to:

- Store large amounts of unstructured data.
- Host media content (images, audio, video) for websites/apps.
- Store data backups, snapshots, and archives.
- Serve as a data lake for analytics or ML workloads.
- Handle log files, IoT data, and streaming content.
- Store build artifacts, binaries, and logs in CI/CD pipelines.

## ‚úÖ DevOps Engineer Use Case

A DevOps Engineer can leverage Azure Blob Storage in the following ways:

### üîπ Artifact Storage

Store build artifacts from tools like Azure DevOps, Jenkins, or GitHub Actions.

Artifacts can include `.zip`, `.dll`, `.jar`, or container images (for registries).

### üîπ Pipeline Integration

Use Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, or REST APIs to upload/download blobs.

```bash
az storage blob upload \
  --account-name mystorageaccount \
  --container-name artifacts \
  --name app-build.zip \
  --file ./builds/app-build.zip \
  --auth-mode login
```

### üîπ Environment Configuration & Secrets

- Store and retrieve environment-specific configurations or secrets  
- (Though Key Vault is preferred for secrets)

### üîπ Logging & Monitoring

- Centralize logs for long-term storage.
- Enable diagnostic logging from resources (App Services, VMs) to be pushed to Blob.

### üîπ Disaster Recovery / Backups

- Schedule regular backups of configurations, state files, and scripts.

## ‚úÖ Storage Tiers in Azure Blob Storage

Azure Blob Storage supports different access tiers to optimize cost:

| Tier    | Use Case                            | Characteristics                                     |
|---------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Hot     | Frequently accessed data             | Highest storage cost, lowest access cost            |
| Cool    | Infrequently accessed data (‚â•30 days)| Lower storage cost, higher access cost              |
| Archive | Rarely accessed data (‚â•180 days)     | Lowest storage cost, highest access latency (hours) |

‚û°Ô∏è You can lifecycle manage blobs to automatically move them between tiers.

## ‚úÖ Redundancy Options (Replication)

Azure offers different redundancy levels for high availability:

| Redundancy Option | Description                                                   |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **LRS**           | Locally Redundant Storage ‚Äì within a single data center       |
| **ZRS**           | Zone-Redundant Storage ‚Äì across 3 AZs within a region         |
| **GRS**           | Geo-Redundant Storage ‚Äì to a secondary region (read-only)     |
| **GZRS / RA-GZRS**| Combines ZRS + GRS ‚Äì best durability and availability         |

---

## ‚úÖ Security Features

- **Encryption**: Server-side encryption (SSE) with Microsoft-managed or customer-managed keys (CMK).
- **Private Endpoints**: Access Blob securely over Azure VNet.
- **RBAC + ACLs**: Access control via Azure AD or Shared Access Signatures (SAS).
- **Immutable Storage**: Time-based retention or legal hold for compliance.

---

## ‚úÖ Tools for Managing Blob Storage

- Azure Portal  
- Azure CLI / PowerShell  
- Azure Storage Explorer (GUI tool)  
- SDKs (Python, .NET, Java, Node.js)
