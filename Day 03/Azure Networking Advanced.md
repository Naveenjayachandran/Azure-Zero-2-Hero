## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Azure Application Gateway & Web Application Firewall (WAF)

Azure Application Gateway is a web traffic load balancer designed to manage and route traffic to web applications, with built-in protection via the Web Application Firewall.

### üîë Key Features:
- **Load Balancing:** Distributes incoming HTTP/HTTPS traffic across multiple backend servers to prevent overload.
- **SSL Termination:** Offloads SSL decryption/encryption to the gateway, improving backend server efficiency.
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Protects applications from common web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and other OWASP threats.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Azure Load Balancer

Azure Load Balancer distributes network traffic to ensure availability and responsiveness of your services.

### üîë Key Features:
- **Load Balancing Algorithms:** Supports round-robin, least connections, and more.
- **Integration with Availability Sets:** Ensures high availability of applications.
- **Inbound and Outbound Traffic:** Balances both incoming and outgoing traffic.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Azure DNS

Azure DNS is a scalable and reliable DNS hosting service leveraging Azure‚Äôs global infrastructure.

### üîë Key Features:
- **Domain Hosting:** Hosts domain names and resolves DNS queries within Azure.
- **Seamless Integration:** Works smoothly with other Azure services like App Service and Traffic Manager.
- **Global Reach:** Provides low-latency DNS responses worldwide via Microsoft‚Äôs global network.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Virtual Network Peering & VNet Gateway

### Virtual Network Peering
Connects two Azure VNets for seamless communication as if on the same network.

- **Global VNet Peering:** Supports peering across Azure regions.
- **Low Latency:** Direct traffic flow without internet routing.
- **No Bandwidth Bottlenecks:** Utilizes Azure backbone network for fast, secure connections.

### VNet Gateway
Enables secure communication between Azure VNets and on-premises networks.

- **Site-to-Site VPN:** Encrypted VPN tunnels for on-premises to Azure connectivity.
- **Point-to-Site VPN:** Allows individual clients to securely connect to Azure resources remotely.
