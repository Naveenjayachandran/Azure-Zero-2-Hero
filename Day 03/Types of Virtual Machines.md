# üíª Types of Virtual Machines on Azure

Azure offers a wide range of Virtual Machine (VM) types to support various workloads and performance needs. Each VM series is tailored with specific configurations for compute, memory, storage, or GPU-intensive tasks.

---

## 1. General Purpose VMs

- **Example:** `Standard_D2s_v3`
- **Description:** Balanced CPU-to-memory ratio, ideal for everyday computing needs.
- **Use Case:** Web servers, small to medium databases, application servers, development/testing environments.

---

## 2. Compute Optimized VMs

- **Example:** `Standard_F2s_v2`
- **Description:** High CPU performance with less memory, designed for compute-heavy workloads.
- **Use Case:** Batch processing, gaming servers, data analysis, CPU-intensive applications.

---

## 3. Memory Optimized VMs

- **Example:** `Standard_E16s_v3`
- **Description:** High memory-to-CPU ratio for memory-intensive workloads.
- **Use Case:** In-memory databases, caching solutions, large-scale data analytics.

---

## 4. Storage Optimized VMs

- **Example:** `Standard_L8s_v2`
- **Description:** Optimized for high disk throughput and low latency.
- **Use Case:** Big data, large databases, data warehousing, log processing.

---

## 5. GPU VMs

- **Example:** `Standard_NC6s_v3`
- **Description:** Includes GPUs for parallel computing and graphical processing.
- **Use Case:** Machine learning, AI inference, 3D rendering, video editing.

---

## 6. High-Performance Compute (HPC) VMs

- **Example:** `Standard_H16r`
- **Description:** Built for large-scale parallel compute workloads requiring low latency.
- **Use Case:** Scientific simulations, engineering tasks, financial risk modeling.

---

## 7. Burstable VMs

- **Example:** `B1s`
- **Description:** Low-cost VMs with a baseline CPU and burst capability.
- **Use Case:** Small websites, microservices, development/testing, apps with variable CPU usage.

## üß≠ Choosing the Right VM Type

When selecting a VM, consider the following factors:

- **üìå Workload Type:**  
  Match the VM to your app‚Äôs resource demand‚Äîcompute, memory, storage, or GPU.

- **‚öôÔ∏è Performance Requirements:**  
  Do you need consistent performance or just periodic bursts?

- **üí∞ Budget Constraints:**  
  Use burstable or general-purpose VMs for cost-effective solutions.

- **üìà Scalability Needs:**  
  Ensure your chosen VM supports vertical scaling (resize) and horizontal scaling (add more VMs).
